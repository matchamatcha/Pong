# Pong

This is a simulation of the game Pong.

The game will have two players. Each player has a racquet.
The racquets may be controlled by each player using the left and right arrow keys for player 1, and keys A and D for player 2, respectively.
Player 1 may use a power up with the key M.
Player 2 may use it too with the key Z.
Whenever this happens, the speed of the ball increases, increasing the difficulty of the game.

The ball returns to the opposite court once it is successfully collides with a racquet.
When a player misses to return the ball to the opposite court, the opposite player receives a point (and vice versa).

The first player to get a score three points will be declared winner.
